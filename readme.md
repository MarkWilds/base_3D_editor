Experimental editor, trying out things that can come in handy for editor creation.

## Libraries
* Swing
* Jogl
* Joml
* substance (for look and feel)

## Conventions
* Left-handed coordinates
* Column major, cause JOML implicitly uses it
* 2D drawing bottomleft is 0,0 (origin)

## todo
* Create decent perspective viewport with realtime fps movement support
* Logging
* Editor Architecture
    * lifecycle
    * windowing (viewport, viewport container)
* Extendable Model/document system
* Update system - https://github.com/threerings/getdown
* Plugin system - https://github.com/decebals/pf4j
